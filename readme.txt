PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN-DEVELOPMENT

Sleep.io is a sleep tracking application aimed at gathering and organizing sleep
data from external devices, such as Fitbits, in a centralized place. Sleep 
disorders are becoming more common so recognizing patterns in sleep can play an 
important factor in the overall health of an individual. 

The overall goal of this project is to create a personalized application that is 
tailored to individual users.
